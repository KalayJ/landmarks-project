Project Title: Landmark Creator - Dynamic Web Programming Midterm Project

Student Name: Mert KalaycÄ±

Description:
This project allows users to add landmarks on a map, categorize them, and create visiting plans by adding visiting notes. Users interact with a dynamic frontend connected to a backend server via Fetch API.

Backend:
- Built with Node.js and Express.
- Provides REST API endpoints for landmarks and visited landmarks.
- Stores data in memory.

Frontend:
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Uses Leaflet.js for the map interface.
- Allows adding landmarks, searching/filtering them, and marking them as visited.

Deployment:
- Backend server runs locally at http://localhost:5000
- Frontend is accessed by opening `index.html` directly.
